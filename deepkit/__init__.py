    Per default this method returns a singleton.

    If you start an experiment using the Deepkit cli (`deepkit run`) or the Deepkit app, the experiment
    is created beforehand and this method picks it up. If an experiment is run without cli or app,
    then this method creates a new one. In any case, this method returns always the same instance, so
    you don't strictly need to save or pass around its return value.

    If you want to create new sub experiments you should use:

        import deepkit
        root_experiment = deepkit.experiment()
        sub_experiment = root_experiment.create_sub_experiment()

    This will create _always_ a new child experiments. In this cases, make sure to call `experiment.done()`,
    (or abort, crashed, failed) manually to end the created experiment and pass around the created experiment
    instance manually (since its not tracked).

    :param project: If the current folder is not linked and you don't specify a project here, an error is raised since
                    Deepkit isn't able to know to which project the experiments data should be sent.
    :param account: Per default the first account linked to this folder is used (see `deepkit link` or `deepkit-sdk auth -l`),
                    this is on a new system `localhost`.
                    You can overwrite which account is used by specifying the name here (see `deepkit id` for
                    available accounts in your system).
